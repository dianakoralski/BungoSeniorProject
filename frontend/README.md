**How to install the frontend on your local dev environment**

1. Clone the github repository on your local environment (if you already did this when setting up the backend, skip this step)
2. Once you have the "Noatanga" folder accessed, run `cd frontend` to access the frontend folder
3. Run `npm install` on your command line, this will install the necessary dependencies for the frontend project
4. Run `npm start` on your command line, you should get a browser that pops up called http://localhost:3000/. This is the current frontend from the code in your local environment with whichever branch you are on.
5. You're all set up! Whenever you need to run the frontend, run `npm start` on your command line. http://localhost:3000/ will auto update with any changes you make to the frontend code, so you don't need to refresh it.
